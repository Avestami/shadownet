# Infinite Redirect Loop Fix

## Problem Identified

When accessing the website with no users in the database, an infinite redirect loop occurred with thousands of GET 200 requests because:

1. **Main page loads** → Tries to fetch user data from `/api/user`
2. **API returns 404** (no authenticated user) → Page sets error but doesn't redirect
3. **Page re-renders** → Tries to fetch user again → Gets 404 again
4. **Infinite loop** continues with constant API calls

## Root Cause

The main page (`app/page.tsx`) was:
- Making API calls to `/api/user` on every render
- Not properly handling 404/401 responses (which are expected for unauthenticated users)
- Using `router.push()` which can cause redirect loops in certain conditions
- Not checking if already on auth pages before redirecting

## Solution Implemented

### ✅ 1. Proper 404/401 Handling
Updated the user fetch logic to treat 404 and 401 responses as expected (not errors):

```typescript
} else if (res.status === 404 || res.status === 401) {
  // User not found or not authenticated - this is expected for new users
  console.log('No authenticated user found, will redirect to login');
  setUser(null);
} else {
  console.error('Failed to fetch user:', res.status);
  setError('Failed to load user data. Please try logging in again.');
}
```

### ✅ 2. Controlled Redirect Logic
Replaced `router.push()` with `window.location.href` and added proper controls:

```typescript
useEffect(() => {
  if (!loading && !user && !hasRedirected && !isDebugMode) {
    // Check if we're not already on a login/register page
    const currentPath = window.location.pathname;
    if (!currentPath.includes('/auth/')) {
      console.log('Redirecting to login - no authenticated user found');
      setHasRedirected(true);
      const timer = setTimeout(() => {
        window.location.href = '/auth/login';
      }, 100);
      return () => clearTimeout(timer);
    }
  }
}, [loading, user, hasRedirected, isDebugMode]);
```

### ✅ 3. Redirect Prevention Mechanisms
- **`hasRedirected` state**: Prevents multiple redirect attempts
- **Path checking**: Doesn't redirect if already on `/auth/` pages
- **Debug mode check**: Doesn't redirect in debug mode
- **Loading state check**: Only redirects after loading is complete

### ✅ 4. Better Error Handling
- Network errors now set `user` to `null` instead of showing error messages
- 404/401 responses are handled as normal flow, not errors
- Clear console logging for debugging

### ✅ 5. Improved Loading State
Changed loading message to be more accurate:
```typescript
<div className="animate-pulse text-xl mb-2">Checking Authentication</div>
```

## Files Modified

### `app/page.tsx`
- Updated user fetch logic to handle 404/401 properly
- Added controlled redirect mechanism with `hasRedirected` state
- Improved error handling for network issues
- Added path checking to prevent redirect loops
- Updated loading state messaging

## Testing Scenarios

### ✅ New User (No Database Users)
1. **Access website** → Shows "Checking Authentication"
2. **API returns 404** → Properly handled, sets user to null
3. **Redirect triggers** → Goes to `/auth/login` (blue login page)
4. **No infinite loop** → Single redirect, no repeated API calls

### ✅ Existing User (Not Logged In)
1. **Access website** → Shows "Checking Authentication"  
2. **API returns 401** → Properly handled, sets user to null
3. **Redirect triggers** → Goes to `/auth/login` (blue login page)
4. **No infinite loop** → Clean redirect flow

### ✅ Authenticated User
1. **Access website** → Shows "Checking Authentication"
2. **API returns user data** → User state set, no redirect
3. **Main interface loads** → Full terminal access with game features

### ✅ Debug Mode
1. **Use bypass command** → Sets debug user in localStorage
2. **No API calls** → Uses localStorage data
3. **No redirects** → Direct access to game interface

## Benefits of This Fix

### 🚫 **Eliminates Infinite Loops**
- Single redirect per session
- No repeated API calls
- Proper state management

### ⚡ **Faster User Experience**
- Quick authentication check (100ms redirect)
- Clear loading states
- No unnecessary delays

### 🛡️ **Robust Error Handling**
- Handles network failures gracefully
- Treats 404/401 as normal flow
- Prevents stuck states

### 🔧 **Better Development Experience**
- Clear console logging
- Debug mode support maintained
- Easy to troubleshoot

## Prevention Measures

### State Management
- `hasRedirected` prevents multiple redirects
- `loading` state controls when redirects can happen
- `isDebugMode` bypasses redirects for development

### Path Checking
- Checks current URL before redirecting
- Prevents redirects when already on auth pages
- Avoids circular navigation

### Timeout Management
- Short timeout (100ms) for quick redirects
- Proper cleanup with `clearTimeout`
- Non-blocking user experience

## Summary

The infinite redirect loop has been **completely eliminated** by:

1. ✅ **Proper 404/401 handling** - Treats unauthenticated state as normal
2. ✅ **Controlled redirects** - Single redirect with state management
3. ✅ **Path awareness** - Doesn't redirect when already on auth pages
4. ✅ **Better error handling** - Network issues don't cause loops
5. ✅ **Debug mode support** - Development workflow preserved

Users now get a **clean, fast authentication flow** with no infinite loops or excessive API calls.
