# Theta Mission Steganography Image
# This PNG image should contain the key "mirr0r" encoded in the LSB (Least Significant Bits)
# In a real implementation, this would be a proper PNG file with binary LSB encoding
# For now, this serves as a reference that the key "mirr0r" is hidden in the image LSBs
