========================================
ZETA LEVEL - DOCKER CONTAINER INSTRUCTIONS
========================================

This Docker container contains a vulnerable web application with JWT (JSON Web Token) authentication issues.

SETUP INSTRUCTIONS:
------------------
1. Extract the zeta-docker.zip file
2. Navigate to the extracted directory
3. Build and run the Docker container:
   ```
   docker build -t zeta-app .
   docker run -p 3000:3000 zeta-app
   ```
4. Access the application at http://localhost:3000

CHALLENGE DETAILS:
-----------------
The admin portal uses JWT for authentication. Your task is to:

1. Analyze the JWT implementation
2. Find and exploit vulnerabilities in the token generation
3. Forge a valid admin token to access protected resources
4. Capture the flag hidden in the admin section

HINTS:
------
- JWT tokens consist of three parts: header, payload, and signature
- Look for weak signing algorithms (like "none" or weak symmetric keys)
- Check if the application verifies the signature properly
- The token might use a predictable secret key
- Try manipulating the "role" claim in the payload

When you find the flag, use the "capture" command in the terminal to submit it.

GOOD LUCK, AGENT!
