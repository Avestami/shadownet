OMEGA MISSION - COOPERATIVE DECRYPTION:

The final cipher requires THREE agents with karma within Â±2 of each other.
Each agent receives a unique key fragment that must be XORed together.

TEAM COOPERATION REQUIREMENTS:
- All 3 agents must have karma within 2 points of each other
- Each agent gets a different key fragment based on their karma range
- All 3 fragments must be XORed together to get the master key

KEY FRAGMENT DISTRIBUTION:
- High Karma Team (karma 15+): Fragment A
- Medium Karma Team (karma 5-14): Fragment B  
- Low Karma Team (karma <5): Fragment C

ENCRYPTED FINAL MESSAGE:
The fate of the Ghost Grid depends on your cooperation.
Only united agents can unlock the truth.

MASTER KEY REQUIRED: m@st3rk3y (result of XOR of all 3 fragments)
