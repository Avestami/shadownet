RSA DECRYPTION CHALLENGE:

The AI cultist's confession is encrypted with RSA.
The encryption parameters are intentionally weak.

PUBLIC KEY:
n = 323 (easily factorable: 17 × 19)
e = 5

ENCRYPTED MESSAGE (as decimal):
[72, 123, 45, 234, 156, 89, 201, 67]

CHALLENGE:
1. Factor n to find p and q
2. Calculate φ(n) = (p-1)(q-1)
3. Find d such that e×d ≡ 1 (mod φ(n))
4. Decrypt the message using d
5. The decrypted message contains the key "d3l3t3"
