# Flag Security Implementation Summary

## Overview

We've successfully implemented a secure system for handling capture flags in the ShadowNet application. The key security improvement is moving flag values from client-side code to server-side environment variables, preventing them from being visible in the browser's inspect element.

## Implementation Details

### 1. Server-Side Flag Storage

- Created `app/lib/flagConstants.ts` to load flags from the `SHADOWNET_FLAGS` environment variable
- Set up the environment variable in Railway with all flag values
- Implemented validation functions to check if submitted flags are valid

### 2. Client-Side Security

- Removed hardcoded flag values from all client-side code
- Created `app/lib/clientFlagUtils.ts` to provide secure flag validation on the client
- Updated components to use pattern matching instead of exact flag values
- Modified the `LevelNavigator` component to check completion without exposing flags

### 3. API Security

- Updated `app/api/capture-flag/route.ts` to validate flags against environment variables
- Added support for both direct flag submission and client-side flag format
- Implemented secure mapping from client-side flag IDs to actual flag values

### 4. Testing

- Created test scripts to verify the implementation:
  - `test-flags.js`: Tests flag validation and pattern matching
  - `test-api.js`: Simulates the API route for flag captures

## Security Benefits

1. **No Exposed Secrets**: Flag values are no longer visible in client-side code
2. **Secure Validation**: All flag validation happens server-side
3. **Flexible Updates**: Flag values can be changed without code modifications
4. **Pattern Matching**: Client uses partial matching to avoid exposing full flags

## Deployment

The changes have been deployed to Railway with the following steps:
1. Pushed code changes to GitHub
2. Set the `SHADOWNET_FLAGS` environment variable in Railway
3. Triggered a deployment

## Testing Results

Our tests confirm that the implementation works correctly:
- Valid flags are accepted and stored
- Invalid flags are rejected
- Client-side flag format is properly mapped to actual flags
- Already captured flags are handled correctly

This implementation significantly improves the security of the ShadowNet application by preventing flag values from being exposed in the client-side code.
