## Game Overview

Project Control puts you in the role of a hacker infiltrating ShadowNet, a rogue AI system that has taken control of critical infrastructure. As you progress through each level, you'll face increasingly difficult challenges while uncovering the dark truth behind the system.

Each level requires you to:
1. Find and capture a hidden flag
2. Make a karma choice that affects your character's alignment
3. Uncover pieces of the narrative that reveal the larger story

## Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/your-username/project-control.git

# Navigate to the project directory
cd project-control

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Set up your database
npx prisma migrate dev

# Start the development server
npm run dev
```

Visit `http://localhost:3000` to begin playing.

## Gameplay

Project Control uses a terminal-based interface to simulate hacking. Here are the common commands available across all levels:

- `ls` - List files in the current directory
- `cat <filename>` - View the contents of a file
- `help` - Show all available commands
- `analyze` - Analyze data files
- `decrypt <file> <key>` - Decrypt an encrypted file
- `capture <flag>` - Capture a flag when you find it
- `choose <option>` - Make a karma choice
- `next` - Go to the next level (after completing current level)

## Level Walkthroughs
