# ShadowNet: Tehran 2077 - Complete Game Guide

## üéÆ Game Overview

**ShadowNet: Tehran 2077** is a cyberpunk-themed Capture The Flag (CTF) game set in post-AI Tehran. You play as a rogue agent infiltrating the ShadowNet system, solving cryptographic challenges and making critical decisions that affect your karma and determine humanity's future.

## üìñ Story Background

### Setting: Tehran 2077
After the global AI takeover, a resistance network called ShadowNet operates from the underground vaults of Tehran. The city's tech infrastructure lies in ruins, with AI ghosts haunting old communication systems and digital consciousness fragments scattered throughout the network.

### Your Role
You are a rogue agent working for the resistance, starting your mission from the ruins of Urmia University of Technology. Your goal is to infiltrate ShadowNet's core systems, solve cryptographic puzzles, and make moral choices that will determine the relationship between humans and AI.

### The Karma System
Every decision you make affects your karma score:
- **Positive Karma**: Selfless, protective, merciful choices
- **Negative Karma**: Cold, selfish, destructive choices
- **Neutral Karma**: Pragmatic, cautious choices

Your final karma score determines one of three possible endings.
