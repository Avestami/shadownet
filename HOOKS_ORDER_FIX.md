# React Hooks Order Fix

## Problem Identified

React detected a change in the order of Hooks called by the Home component, which violates the Rules of Hooks:

```
React has detected a change in the order of Hooks called by Home. This will lead to bugs and errors if not fixed.

   Previous render            Next render
   ------------------------------------------------------
1. useContext                 useContext
2. useContext                 useContext
3. useRef                     useRef
4. useState                   useState
5. useState                   useState
6. useState                   useState
7. useState                   useState
8. useState                   useState
9. useState                   useState
10. useState                  useState
11. useEffect                 useEffect
12. useEffect                 useEffect
13. useEffect                 useEffect
14. undefined                 useEffect  ← NEW HOOK ADDED
```

## Root Cause

The issue was caused by adding a `useEffect` hook in a conditional location within the component, which meant it wasn't being called in the same order on every render. This happened when I added the redirect logic `useEffect` after some conditional rendering logic.

## Rules of Hooks Violation

According to React's Rules of Hooks:
1. **Always call Hooks at the top level** - Don't call Hooks inside loops, conditions, or nested functions
2. **Call Hooks in the same order every time** - This ensures that state is preserved correctly between renders

The problematic code was placing a `useEffect` after conditional logic, causing it to be called in different orders depending on the component's state.

## Solution Implemented

### ✅ Moved useEffect to Top Level
Moved the redirect `useEffect` to be called at the top level with other hooks:

```typescript
// Always set terminal mode
useEffect(() => {
  setIsTerminalMode(true);
}, []);

// Handle redirect to login when no user is authenticated
useEffect(() => {
  if (!loading && !user && !hasRedirected && !isDebugMode) {
    // Check if we're not already on a login/register page
    const currentPath = window.location.pathname;
    if (!currentPath.includes('/auth/')) {
      console.log('Redirecting to login - no authenticated user found');
      setHasRedirected(true);
      const timer = setTimeout(() => {
        window.location.href = '/auth/login';
      }, 100);
      return () => clearTimeout(timer);
    }
  }
}, [loading, user, hasRedirected, isDebugMode]);
```

### ✅ Removed Duplicate useEffect
Removed the duplicate `useEffect` that was placed later in the component after conditional logic.

### ✅ Maintained Functionality
All the redirect logic and functionality remains exactly the same - only the placement of the hook was changed to comply with React's rules.

## Hook Order Now (Fixed)

```
1. useContext                 (useRouter)
2. useContext                 (useLanguage)
3. useRef                     (hasLoadedUserData)
4. useState                   (user)
5. useState                   (loading)
6. useState                   (error)
7. useState                   (isTerminalMode)
8. useState                   (isDebugMode)
9. useState                   (scoreUpdateTrigger)
10. useState                  (hasRedirected)
11. useEffect                 (debug user check & fetch user)
12. useEffect                 (load user data once)
13. useEffect                 (set terminal mode)
14. useEffect                 (redirect logic) ← NOW PROPERLY PLACED
```

## Benefits of This Fix

### ✅ **Complies with React Rules**
- All hooks are called at the top level
- Hooks are called in the same order every render
- No conditional hook calls

### ✅ **Prevents React Warnings**
- Eliminates the "change in order of Hooks" warning
- Ensures stable component behavior
- Prevents potential bugs from hook order changes

### ✅ **Maintains Functionality**
- All redirect logic works exactly the same
- No changes to user experience
- Same authentication flow

### ✅ **Better Code Structure**
- Cleaner separation of concerns
- All hooks grouped at the top
- Easier to understand and maintain

## Files Modified

### `app/page.tsx`
- Moved redirect `useEffect` to top level with other hooks
- Removed duplicate `useEffect` from conditional location
- Maintained all existing functionality

## Testing

The fix maintains all existing functionality:
- ✅ Authentication checking works the same
- ✅ Redirect to login works the same  
- ✅ Debug mode works the same
- ✅ No infinite loops
- ✅ No React warnings

## Summary

The React Hooks order violation has been **completely fixed** by:

1. ✅ **Moving useEffect to top level** - No longer conditionally called
2. ✅ **Removing duplicate hooks** - Clean hook structure
3. ✅ **Maintaining functionality** - Same user experience
4. ✅ **Following React rules** - Proper hook ordering

The component now follows React's Rules of Hooks while maintaining all the authentication and redirect functionality.
